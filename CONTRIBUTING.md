## How to contribute to Ilch

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**, and instead get in contact with a team member [Ilch Team](https://www.ilch.de/team.html).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/IlchCMS/Ilch-2.0/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/IlchCMS/Ilch-2.0/issues/new/choose). Be sure to include a **title and clear description** and as much relevant information as possible.

* If possible, use the relevant templates to create the issue.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Keep in mind that the Ilch CMS isn't only intended for usage in gaming clans, but also for a more general usage. Features therefore should be useful outside the gaming world too.

#### **Do you have questions about Ilch?**

* Ask any question about it in the [official forum](https://www.ilch.de/forum.html).
